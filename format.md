## ⚒️ Format
* The presenter prepares a paper or a topic to discuss, and a coding tutorial to go along it:
   * both the paper presentation and the tutorial should be around 45min
   * Then we'll have 15min for questions and discussion.
   * We usually present a topic of interest, focusing on the paper that originated its key ideas. 
   * But focusing on a specific paper is also fine! Just be aware that most of our audience are techies but maybe not experts in computer vision, and we would like most people to be able to follow through.
* We'd like to be quite flexible on the paper presentation format so we leave that up to the speaker! 
* Some ideas for the coding tutorial: 
   * it could be reproducing some of the paper's figures,
   * a notebook based on a tutorial available online, or a proposed project to work on the next few weeks using the paper's repo.

* For now, we are filling any suggestions for topics in this [Spreadsheet for papers + possible tutorials, and speakers, etc](https://liveuclac-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/ccaemxo_ucl_ac_uk/Eb45VIEdVnFKhrKeyKOAEBIBip0HSNdSq8EAvZv-oO9n3w?e=3WQF1d) 

* Going forward we may consider a voting system: This might be a good way to find common areas of interest!
