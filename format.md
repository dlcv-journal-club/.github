## Format of the JC
* The idea is to prepare a paper to discuss + a coding tutorial to go along it
    * We'd like to be quite flexible on the paper presentation format so we leave that up to the speaker. 
    * To start with we are thinking one speaker preenting one paper, but this could also be more flexible, for example:  
        *  One paper each â€” coordinated: the coordinator is forced to choose a topic, screen several articles and make a selection of four references to be presented in hour session.
        * One paper each frestyle: Four participants describe an article of their choice to be presented in hour session.
    * Some ideas for the coding tutorial: it could be reproducing some of the paper's figures, a notebook based on a tutorial available online, or a proposed project to work on the next few weeks using the paper's repo.
    * Potentially useful resources for the tutorial: PaperWithCode, existing projects in HuggingFace, Kaggle
    * We are thinking of hosting the tutorials material in a GitHub repo
        * Create an space to organise JC4RSE (e.g., https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v2MlfgkwUY, repo?) 
* For now, we are filling in this [Spreadsheet for papers + possible tutorials, and speakers, etc](https://liveuclac-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/ccaemxo_ucl_ac_uk/Eb45VIEdVnFKhrKeyKOAEBIBip0HSNdSq8EAvZv-oO9n3w?e=3WQF1d) 
* Going forward we would like to have a voting system: This might be a good way to find common areas of interest https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v2MlfgkwUY.
